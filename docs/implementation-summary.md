# Property Management Implementation Summary

We've successfully implemented complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for properties in the application. This implementation follows the same pattern established earlier for the event management features, ensuring a consistent user experience throughout the application.

## API Endpoints

1. **Properties API Routes**
   - `POST /api/properties` - Create a new property
   - `GET /api/properties/:id` - Get details for a specific property
   - `PUT /api/properties/:id` - Update an existing property
   - `DELETE /api/properties/:id` - Delete a property (with proper validation checks)

## Components Created

1. **Form Components**
   - `CreatePropertyForm` - Form for adding new properties with validation and error handling
   - `EditPropertyForm` - Form for editing existing properties, presented in a dialog/modal

## UI Integration

1. **Properties List Page (`/dashboard/admin/properties`)**

   - Added "Add Property" button that opens the create form
   - Implemented edit functionality that opens the edit dialog/modal
   - Integrated delete functionality with confirmation dialog

2. **Property Detail Page (`/dashboard/admin/properties/[id]`)**
   - Added edit button that opens the edit form dialog
   - Implemented delete button with confirmation dialog
   - Ensured proper navigation back to the properties list after operations

## Features

1. **Property Forms**

   - Comprehensive validation using Zod schema
   - Support for all property fields: name, type, address, specifications, etc.
   - Parent property selection for creating hierarchical relationships
   - Active/inactive status toggle

2. **Delete Validation**

   - Prevents deletion of properties with children, requiring removal of children first
   - Prevents deletion of properties with associated events or rental contracts
   - Shows appropriate error messages to guide user actions

3. **User Experience**
   - Success/error toast notifications for all operations
   - Immediate UI updates after operations through page refreshes
   - Consistent form styling and behavior

## Next Steps

1. **User Management**: Implement similar CRUD functionality for users
2. **Rental Contracts**: Create CRUD operations for rental contracts
3. **Dashboard Improvements**: Add summary statistics and visualizations
4. **Responsive Enhancements**: Ensure optimal experience across all device sizes

This implementation provides a robust foundation for property management within the application, with proper error handling, data validation, and a smooth user experience.
